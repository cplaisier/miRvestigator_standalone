This is a program to identify miRNAs from a Position Specific Scoring Matrix. A PSSM is read from a user specified file and is then passed to miRvestigator which downloads the mature miRNA seed seqeunces from miRbase.org and compares these mature seed sequences against the PSSM. This is accomplished by converting the PSSM into a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), very similar to a profile HMM, and then using the Viterbi algorithm to simultaneously align and calcualte a probabilty for the alighment of the miRNA seed to the HMM. A p-value is calculated by exhaustively comparing all potential miRNA seed sequneces that could bind to 3' UTRs, and using simulations the p-value for the Viterbi probability is the optimal metric for gauging miRNA seed to PSSM similarity.

In order to run this program you will need:

Python (www.python.org)
Active internet connection to download latest miRBase release (mature.fa.gz)

For python programs the program file 'miRvestigator_standalone.py' must be prefaced with 'python' in order to run. Thus use the command 'python miRvestigator_standalone.py' to see the command line help:

Usage: python miRvestigator_standalone.py -p example.fasta -s hsa -wobble NA -6
N -7 N -8 Y

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PSSMFILE, --pssmFile=PSSMFILE
                        [Required] Name of the PSSM file entered using a fasta
                        like format where each motif is named and is followed
                        with rows A, C, G, T and columns equal to the lenght
                        of the motif (values in the matrix should be separated
                        by spaces). The values entered should be probabilities
                        and the columns should sum to 1.
  -s SPECIES, --species=SPECIES
                        Species code whose miRNAs the PSSMs should be compared
                        against. Common species codes (<code> = <species>):
                        cel = Caenorhabditis elegans (worm), dme = Drosophila
                        melanogaster (fly), gga = Gallus gallus (chicken), hsa
                        = Homo sapiens (human), mmu = Mus musculus (mice), rno
                        = Rattus norvegicus (rat). Defaults to hsa, human.
  -w WOBBLE, --wobble=WOBBLE
                        Whether wobble base-pairing should be modeled. Set to
                        minimum frequency of G or U (default is 0.25).
  -6 M6, --6mer=M6      Whether 6mer seed model should be included. (Y or N).
                        Defaults to Y.
  -7 M7, --7mer=M7      Whether 7mer seed model should be included. (Y or N).
                        Defaults to Y.
  -8 M8, --8mer=M8      Whether 8mer seed model should be included. (Y or N).
                        Defaults to Y.

If the species being studied is human then you need only specify the pssm file in fasta format. Here is an example fasta pssm entry:

>hsa-miR-1
0.80 0.01 0.75 0.01 0.02 0.10 0.05 0.99
0.04 0.85 0.10 0.01 0.10 0.60 0.80 0.00
0.05 0.02 0.10 0.10 0.02 0.20 0.05 0.00
0.11 0.02 0.05 0.88 0.86 0.10 0.10 0.01

If using another species enter the species code. Any species available on miRBase should work with miRvestigator including the most common species:

- cel = Caenorhabditis elegans (worm)
- dme = Drosophila melanogaster (fly)
- gga = Gallus gallus (chicken)
- hsa = Homo sapiens (human)
- mmu = Mus musculus (mouse)
- rno = Rattus norvegicus (rat) 

Wobble base-pairing may be turned on or off by either supplying a minimum frequency (default is 0.25) or not, respecitively. Finally, the 6-, 7- and 8-mer seed models are by default turned on, and by setting them to 'N' they can be turned off.

More than one motif may be input into the miRvestigator HMM stand alone application. The results for each PSSM are placed into a <PSSM-NAME>.csv file in the sub-directory called 'miRNA' as CSV files and ranked based on the Viterbi P-Value (smallest to largest).

Thus this provides an alternative to the miRvestigator web server (mirvestigator.systemsbiology.org) if motif are derived using an alternative de novo motif detection algorithm.
