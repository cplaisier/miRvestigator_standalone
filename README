This is a program to identify miRNAs from a Position Specific Scoring Matrix. A PSSM is read from a user specified file and is then passed to miRvestigator which downloads the mature miRNA seed seqeunces from miRbase.org and compares these mature seed sequences against the PSSM. This is accomplished by converting the PSSM into a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), very similar to a profile HMM, and then using the Viterbi algorithm to simultaneously align and calcualte a probabilty for the alighment of the miRNA seed to the HMM. A p-value is calculated by exhaustively comparing all potential miRNA seed sequneces that could bind to 3' UTRs, and using simulations the p-value for the Viterbi probability is the optimal metric for gauging miRNA seed to PSSM similarity.

This is the command line help from the miRvestigator python object:

Usage: miRvestigator_standalone.py [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PSSMFILE, --pssmFile=PSSMFILE
                        Name of the PSSM file entered using a fasta like
                        format where each motif is named and is followed with
                        rows A, C, G, T and columns equal to the lenght of the
                        motif (values in the matrix should be separated by
                        spaces). The values entered should be probabilities
                        and the columns should sum to 1. (Required)
  -s SPECIES, --species=SPECIES
                        Species code whose miRNAs the PSSMs should be compared
                        against. Common species codes (<code> = <species>):
                        cel = Caenohabditis elegans (worm), dme = Drosophila
                        melanogaster (fly), gga = Gallus gallus (chicken), hsa
                        = Homo sapiens (human), mmu = Mus musculus (mice), rno
                        = Rattus norvegicus (rat).
  -w WOBBLE, --wobble=WOBBLE
                        Whether wobble base-pairing should be modeled. Set to
                        minimum frequency of G or U (default is 0.25).
  -6 M6, --6mer=M6      Whether 6mer seed model should be included. (Y or N).
                        Defaults to Y.
  -7 M7, --7mer=M7      Whether 6mer seed model should be included. (Y or N).
                        Defaults to Y.
  -8 M8, --8mer=M8      Whether 6mer seed model should be included. (Y or N).
                        Defaults to Y.

More than one motif may be input into the miRvestigator HMM stand alone application. The results for each PSSM are placed into a <PSSM-NAME>.csv file in the sub-directory called 'miRNA' as CSV files and ranked based on the Viterbi P-Value (smallest to largest).
